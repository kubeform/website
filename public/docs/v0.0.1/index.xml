If you need to create a cloud infrastructure from kubernetes to use it with any kubernetes workloads or CRD you might want to create it from kubernetes. Kubeform allows you to create cloud infrastructure from kubernetes. You can just write a CRD for a cloud infrastructure, apply it and Kubeform will create it!
