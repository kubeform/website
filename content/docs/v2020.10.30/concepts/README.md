  - [Architecture](/docs/v2020.10.30/concepts/what-is-kubeform/architecture) provides a visual representation of Kubeform architecture. It also provides a brief overview of the components it uses.
  - [TFState](/docs/v2020.10.30/concepts/what-is-kubeform/tfstate) provides an description of how kubeform handles the `tfstate`.
